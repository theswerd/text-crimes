## What is this?

A set of obscure Unicode characters (Tajweed marks used in the Qur'an) have unusual properties: they're zero-width, stack vertically, and don't affect their container's bounding box. This lets you create images that rۛۛۛۛۛenۛۛۛۛۛdeۛۛۛۛۛrۛۛۛۛۛ as tall towers of marks while technically being a single line of text.
